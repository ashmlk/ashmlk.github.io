            <p class="description">My main skills in programming are implementing different algorithms in order to solve different problems
that may be complicated to solve with the human mind! I have worked on various projects that used well-known algorithms such as 
<em>Back tracking, Graph traversals, Array searching & sorting, recursion and memoization.</em><br> These algorithms were mostly implemented
to enhace program speed and save memory space. Also, I have personally developed skills in We development and visual design using <em>CSS</em> and <em>HTML</em>.
I have also built many GUI frameworks in <em>Java</em> that has helped me build many user interface softwares.

              <dt>Poker Game</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">A simple poker game, that the computer shuffles the cards and plays with itself,
the main focus of this game was implementing array sorting and searching methods, 
on one and two dimensional arrays, and decreasing the program run-time by
using recursion and memoization. This project improved my skills in saving memory space
and achieving slower run-time in array searching and sorting.</dd>
              <dt>Grocery Cart Stimulator</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">This project was a grocery cart simulator (The ones you may find in grocery stores)
The main focus of this project was to build a proper GUI that could give the user
the proper functionality of a grocery cart. This project improved my skills in user interface design.</dd>
              <dt>WordFiller and WordPacking</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">Creating algorithmic programs for guessing words in a pattern and packing them based on their alphabets. 
These projects focused on implementing data structures and algorithms on data for maximizing efficiency of the programs. Main algorithms used are recursion, 
backtracking and memoization, which improved my skills in saving memory time and space.</dd>
              <dt>Siren Records</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">"Siren Records" is a music application written in Java, with basic functionality and user interface,
which users are able to add songs to playlist, add to queue and etc. This application is written in Java, and was focused on writing tests, 
refactoring and software engineering techniques.</dd>
              <dt>To-Do Application</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">A To-Do list application written in Java. In this application users are
able to add tasks and sort them based on their own preferences of name, date or priority. It is simple list to 
keep track of users tasks and for user to be able manage their time efficiently.
                </dd>
                <dt>Map</dt>
                <dd class="project_description">This program is an application on graphs. The program is based on the graph of 18 cities in 
Canada(The graph's image is available on Github). The purpose of this application is to find the shortest distance between a source city which the application prompts the user to input. 
The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance between the cities and the source. However, the runtime of the 
program is O(V^2), which is not the best, and can be reduced to O(ElogV) by implementing a binary heap on all vertices in order, to use
MinHeap for achieving a lower O(n).
